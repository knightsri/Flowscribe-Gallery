### Executive Summary
WordPress exhibits the architectural characteristics of a legacy monolithic CMS that has evolved over 20+ years from a simple blogging platform to a complex content management system. The codebase reveals significant technical debt, particularly in its layer separation and dependency management, with 10 architectural violations indicating improper dependencies from Core to Admin layers. The system demonstrates a procedural-to-object-oriented transition that remains incomplete, with heavy reliance on global state, procedural functions mixed with OOP patterns, and inconsistent architectural boundaries.

Despite these challenges, WordPress maintains remarkable backward compatibility and extensibility through its plugin/hook system, which has become both its greatest strength and architectural constraint. The recent addition of the Block Editor (Gutenberg) introduces modern patterns but also creates architectural friction with the legacy codebase. The system's scalability is proven in production at massive scale, yet individual component quality varies dramatically from well-architected (e.g., REST API, HTML Processor) to deeply problematic (e.g., wpdb global coupling, mixed concerns in wp-includes).

The fundamental challenge is that WordPress must simultaneously serve as a simple blogging tool, enterprise CMS, and application framework—requirements that create inherent architectural tensions that cannot be fully resolved without breaking backward compatibility, which remains the project's paramount constraint.
