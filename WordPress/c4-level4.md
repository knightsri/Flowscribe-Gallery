# WordPress - C4 Level 4: Code-Level Architecture

**Generated:** 2025-10-15 04:24:39  
**Domain:** content management  
**Diagram Level:** C4 Level 4 (Code - Selective)

---

## Overview

This document presents **detailed code-level architecture** for the most significant components in WordPress.

Unlike a comprehensive code documentation (which would be overwhelming), this focuses on the **10-12 most architecturally important components** that reveal:
- Core domain logic and business workflows
- Critical infrastructure patterns
- Complex algorithms and design decisions
- Key integration points

---

## Selection Rationale

I prioritized components that embody WordPress's core content management workflows, such as post and media handling, while balancing critical infrastructure like database and admin layers for high impact. Selection emphasized integration points like XML-RPC and complex systems like the HTML processor for pedagogical insights, drawing from file size and architectural layers to ensure coverage of domain logic, algorithms, and extensibility.

## Honorable Mentions

These components are also architecturally significant but not included in the top 12:

### Formatting Utilities
**File:** `wp-includes/formatting.php`

**Why Notable:** Contains essential text processing functions, but is more utility-focused than core domain logic.

### PclZip Library
**File:** `wp-admin/includes/class-pclzip.php`

**Why Notable:** Handles archive operations for theme/plugin installation, but external library integration is peripheral.

### Deprecated Functions
**File:** `wp-includes/deprecated.php`

**Why Notable:** Archives old functions for backward compatibility, but lacks pedagogical value as a modern architectural component.

### Taxonomy System
**File:** `wp-includes/taxonomy.php`

**Why Notable:** Manages categories and tags closely tied to posts, but subordinated to post.php in core logic.

### Plugin API
**File:** `wp-includes/plugin.php`

**Why Notable:** Essential for extensibility, but hooks system is partly covered in functions.php, making it a secondary focus.
