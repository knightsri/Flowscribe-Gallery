## Component Overview

### Purpose
This component provides a centralized data structure defining the JSON schemas, attributes, supports, and metadata for core Gutenberg blocks in WordPress, facilitating their registration and behavior within the block editor.

### Responsibility
To encapsulate and provide static definitions for WordPress core blocks as a declarative array.

## Integration Points

- WordPress Block Registration API: The data is used to register core blocks during WordPress initialization.
- Gutenberg Block Editor: Integrates with the JavaScript-based editor to define block properties, rendering, and controls.
- WordPress Theme and Plugin Systems: Provides base configurations that themes and plugins can extend or override.

## Architectural Notes

This component follows a declarative configuration approach for blocks, adhering to the JSON schema standard (referenced via '$schema') with an apiVersion of 3, enabling extensible and modular block definitions. It centralizes block metadata in a single file for ease of maintenance and consistency, while supporting advanced features like interactivity, spacing, and typography through nested supports arrays. Attributes are defined with types, defaults, and roles, promoting type safety and clear data flow in the block ecosystem.
