# 🏛️ Flowscribe Gallery
*A living showcase of automated architecture intelligence across the open‑source world.*

Flowscribe Gallery curates complete, AI‑generated architecture analyses of well‑known open‑source projects — produced by the **Flowscribe** toolchain. Each entry captures the full **C4 model (Levels 1–4)**, an automated **Architecture Review**, and **usage‑first cost metrics**, making modern systems transparent and explainable.

## 🌍 Projects

| Project | Domain | Highlights |
|---|---|---|
| [WordPress](./WordPress/README.md) | CMS / PHP | Rich Mermaid layers with **real inter‑layer arrows** (Deptrac rules), L2 **violations table**, L4 code docs, and OpenRouter‑based cost metrics |
| [CodeIgniter4](./CodeIgniter4/README.md) | Web Development | With PSR compliance while maintaining its "lightweight and example" philosophy. Despite the concerns, the community around supports with active development and committed to modern PHP standards. |
